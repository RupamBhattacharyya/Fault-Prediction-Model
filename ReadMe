All the algorithms are checked and tested on MATLAB. 

All the source code files need to be placed along with the `Dataâ€™ folder. For getting access to this "Data" please drop me a mail.

During initial execution, user has to locate the folder containing csv files. Afterwards, one csv file need 
to be chosen by the users for training and prediction purpose. The software has the provision to consider 
all the csv files. However, for the sake faster execution, this restriction is placed.
